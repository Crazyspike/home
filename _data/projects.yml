  name: 'Image Reconstruction via Spiking Neural Model from Spike Camera'
  description: >
    In this paper, we have proposed a novel three-layer spiking neural model to reconstruct visual images for spike camera. We comprehensively discuss the spike distribution and construct a probability model to describe it. Additionally, a dynamic neuron extraction model is proposed to distinguish the dynamic and static neurons. A combination of biologically plausible mechanisms in introduced to process the continuous-time spikes. Finally, the visual image can be reconstructed according to the state of the neuron and firing threshold.
