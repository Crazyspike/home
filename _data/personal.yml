intro:
  title: Hello!
  body: >
    I'm a Ph.D. student in the 
    [Institute of Digital Media (NELVT)](https://pkuml.org//) at [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn//).
    My advisor is Prof. Yonghong Tian. 
    My research interest is neuromorphic vision, spiking neural network and low-level vision. 
    Our team developed a neuromorphic vision sensor called spike camera. 
    Our work explored how to reconstruct texture images from the spike data (generated from the spike camera) and compress the spike data.
